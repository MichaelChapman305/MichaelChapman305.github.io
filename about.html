            <h2>Software Engineer, Musician, Outdoorsman</h2>
            <p class="bio__container-description">Iâ€™m Michael and I hail from the wild and wonderful mountains of West Virginia.
              A little over a year ago, I earned my bachelors in English from Marshall University and shortly after that I fell in
              love with software development. Having no formal engineering education, I've learned the ins and outs of programming
              through using online resources and by building engaging personal projects.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__container-description">In my spare time, I can usually be found adventuring outdoors or playing music on my guitar.
              Growing up in West Virginia, I've had the opportunities to take up many outdoor sports such as backpacking, snowboarding, white
              water rafting and kayaking, mountain biking and more. Writing music and playing guitar have also been lifelong hobbies of mine
              and one of my most valued creative outlets alongside of designing user interfaces for the projects I undertake.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__container-description">Whether I'm working on a tough engineering problem, writing a new song, or backpacking 30
              miles from civilization, I believe that curiosity and a drive to learn will continue to carry us to new heights.
              It is this train of thought that I hold valuable in my endeavors and continues to motivate me in building new technologies that can
              improve people's lives.
