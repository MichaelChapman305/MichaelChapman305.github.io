            <h2>Software Engineer, Musician, Outdoorsman</h2>
            <p class="bio__container-description">Having no formal programming education, I started learning web development
              through online resources such as freeCodeCamp, "You Don't Know JS", Mozilla, etc. Since then I have
              gained tremendous experience by working on several projects through both online programs and developing ideas of my own.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__container-description">If i'm not programming at my computer I can usually be found somewhere outdoors.
              As an avid nature enthusiest I find passion in backpacking and camping as I do in programming. Growing up in West Virginia I have
              also had the opportunities to take up other outdoor sports such as snowboarding, white water rafting, kayaking, mountain biking, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="bio__container-description">Whether i'm working on a complex programming solution or backpacking 30
              miles away from civilization, I believe that curiosity and a drive to learn will continue to carry us to new heights.
              It is this philosophy I hold most valuable in my endeavors, and what continues to move me forward in all aspect of my life.
